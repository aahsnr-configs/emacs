Of course. Here is a refined, well-formatted guide to integrating the Jupyter Notebook configuration into your Emacs setup.

### **Jupyter Integration for Emacs Configuration**

Here are the necessary changes to integrate a seamless Jupyter Notebook experience into your Emacs configuration, focusing on Python programming within Org mode.

---

### 1. New Section: Jupyter Notebook

This entire block should be added as a new top-level section in your `init.txt` file. For best organization, it is recommended to place it before the `* Development Tools` section.

```org
* Jupyter Notebook
This section integrates the Jupyter ecosystem into Emacs, providing a powerful,
interactive environment for Python programming directly within Org mode.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package jupyter
  :hook (org-mode . jupyter-org-mode)
  :custom
  ;; A list of kernelspec names that should be displayed at the top of the list
  ;; of kernels.
  (jupyter-favorite-kernels '("python3"))
  ;; Do not display "Evaluating..." messages in the REPL.
  (jupyter-repl-echo-evaluating-p nil)
  :config
  ;; When this is non-nil, jupyter-org buffers will get a client for the kernel
  ;; specified by the first `jupyter-python' src block.
  (setq jupyter-org-get-client-on-load t))
#+end_src

** Org Mode Integration
This configures Org Babel to use Jupyter for python code blocks. It enables
asynchronous execution by default and ensures results, including plots, are
displayed inline.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(with-eval-after-load 'org
  ;; Load the jupyter language for org-babel
  (org-babel-do-load-languages
   'org-babel-load-languages
   '((jupyter . t)))

  ;; Set default header arguments for python source blocks to use jupyter
  (setq org-babel-default-header-args:python
      '((:results . "replace drawer")
        (:async . "yes")
        (:session . "python")
        (:kernel . "python3")))

  ;; Add hook to redisplay inline images after execution, for plots
  (add-hook 'org-babel-after-execute-hook 'org-redisplay-inline-images))
#+end_src
```

---

### 2. Modification to Existing Configuration

A small change is required in your existing Org mode configuration to avoid conflicts.

#### **File Location:** `* Org Mode` -> `** Babel & Structure Templates`

In this section, you must remove the line that loads the standard `python` babel language, as all Python execution will now be managed by the new `jupyter` integration.

**BEFORE:**

```emacs-lisp
(with-eval-after-load 'org
  ;; Load common languages for Babel.
  (org-babel-do-load-languages
   'org-babel-load-languages
   '((emacs-lisp . t)
     (python . t)
     (shell . t)
     (sql . t)))

  (add-hook 'org-babel-after-execute-hook 'org-redisplay-inline-images)

  (require 'org-tempo)
  (add-to-list 'org-structure-template-alist '("sh" . "src shell"))
  (add-to-list 'org-structure-template-alist '("el" . "src emacs-lisp"))
  (add-to-list 'org-structure-template-alist '("py" . "src python")))
```

**AFTER:**

```emacs-lisp
(with-eval-after-load 'org
  ;; Load common languages for Babel.
  (org-babel-do-load-languages
   'org-babel-load-languages
   '((emacs-lisp . t)
     ;; (python . t) ;; This is now handled by the Jupyter integration
     (shell . t)
     (sql . t)))

  (add-hook 'org-babel-after-execute-hook 'org-redisplay-inline-images)

  (require 'org-tempo)
  (add-to-list 'org-structure-template-alist '("sh" . "src shell"))
  (add-to-list 'org-structure-template-alist '("el" . "src emacs-lisp"))
  ;; The line below is changed to use the new jupyter backend for python snippets
  (add-to-list 'org-structure-template-alist '("py" . "src jupyter-python")))
```

### 3. Keybindings

No changes are needed for your keybindings. The existing Jupyter keybindings under the leader key `o j` are correctly defined and will work with this new configuration.
