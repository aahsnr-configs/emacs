Of course. Here is the complete snippets configuration, rewritten to use `yasnippet-snippets` instead of `doom-snippets`.

The `yasnippet-snippets` package is the official and most comprehensive community-maintained collection for `yasnippet`. This configuration ensures it's properly installed and loaded, while maintaining all the advanced features like auto-reloading and deep integration with your completion framework.

## Final Snippet Configuration with `yasnippet-snippets`

This setup provides a robust and modern snippet experience by combining `yasnippet` with the official `yasnippet-snippets` collection. It is fully integrated with your `Corfu`, `Cape`, and `Consult` powered workflow.

This configuration is designed as a complete, drop-in replacement for the snippets section in your `config.org` file.

### 1. Snippets: Core Engine and Official Collection

This section configures `yasnippet` as the core engine, pulls in the `yasnippet-snippets` collection, and establishes a robust, save-based automatic reloading mechanism for your personal snippets.

```org
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; This is the directory where you will store your personal snippets.
(defvar my/snippets-directory (expand-file-name "snippets" user-emacs-directory)
  "Directory for personal yasnippet snippets.")

;; Create the custom snippets directory if it doesn't exist.
(unless (file-directory-p my/snippets-directory)
  (make-directory my/snippets-directory t))

(use-package yasnippet
  :defer t
  :hook (after-init . yas-global-mode)
  :custom
  ;; Use a completing-read prompt for a better UI when multiple snippets match.
  (yas-prompt-functions '(yas-completing-prompt))
  :config
  ;; --- Add Personal Snippets Directory ---
  ;; This adds your custom directory to yasnippet's search path.
  ;; We use `add-to-list` in the `:config` block to ensure we append our
  ;; directory without overwriting the default paths, which yasnippet
  ;; uses to find the `yasnippet-snippets` collection automatically.
  (add-to-list 'yas-snippet-dirs my/snippets-directory)

  ;; --- Integration with Corfu/Cape ---
  ;; This is crucial. It prevents Yasnippet from trying to expand on its own,
  ;; letting the Cape backend handle the completion and expansion.
  (yas-set-trigger-key-for-major-mode 'text-mode nil)

  ;; --- Keybinding Setup ---
  ;; When a snippet is active, TAB should only jump between fields.
  ;; This prevents conflicts and ensures predictable behavior.
  (define-key yas-minor-mode-map (kbd "<tab>") nil)
  (define-key yas-minor-mode-map (kbd "TAB") #'yas-next-field-or-maybe-expand)
  (define-key yas-minor-mode-map (kbd "<backtab>") #'yas-previous-field)

  ;; --- Robust, Save-Based Automatic Snippet Reloading ---
  ;; This function reloads snippets automatically whenever a snippet file is saved.
  (defun ar/yas-reload-snippets-on-save ()
    "Reload all snippets if a snippet file is being saved."
    (when (string-prefix-p my/snippets-directory (buffer-file-name))
      (yas-reload-all)
      (message "Yasnippet collection reloaded.")))

  (add-hook 'after-save-hook #'ar/yas-reload-snippets-on-save))

;; Installs the official community-maintained collection of snippets.
(use-package yasnippet-snippets
  :after yasnippet
  :demand t) ;; Ensure it's downloaded and available
#+end_src
```

### 2. Completion Framework Integration

This is the critical link that makes snippets appear directly in your `corfu` completion pop-up. This configuration for `cape` remains unchanged but is essential for the system to work.

**Ensure your `(use-package cape ...)` block matches this:**

```org
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package cape
  ;; Add cape-yasnippet to the commands list.
  :commands (cape-dabbrev cape-file cape-keyword cape-yasnippet)
  :init
  ;; Add the YASnippet backend to the completion-at-point functions.
  ;; Placing it first gives it high priority in the completion list.
  (add-to-list 'completion-at-point-functions #'cape-yasnippet)
  (add-to-list 'completion-at-point-functions #'cape-dabbrev)
  (add-to-list 'completion-at-point-functions #'cape-file)
  (add-to-list 'completion-at-point-functions #'cape-keyword)
  (add-to-list 'completion-at-point-functions #'cape-elisp-symbol)
  :config
  ;; Silence the noisy pcomplete capf
  (advice-add 'pcomplete-completions-at-point :around #'cape-wrap-silent))
#+end_src
```

### 3. Enhanced User Experience with Consult

To make browsing and inserting snippets a modern, interactive experience, we integrate `yasnippet` with `consult`. This provides a fuzzy-findable list of all available snippets with live previews.

```org
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Integrates yasnippet with your consult-based workflow for a superior
;; snippet insertion and browsing experience.
(use-package consult-yasnippet
  :after (consult yasnippet)
  :config
  ;; You can customize the preview behavior if desired.
  (consult-customize consult-yasnippet :preview-key 'any))
#+end_src
```

### 4. Keybindings for Snippet Management

These keybindings, using your `ar/global-leader` prefix, provide quick access to all essential snippet functionality.

**Add this block to your `(ar/global-leader ...)` form:**

```org
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
"s" '(:ignore t :wk "snippets")
;; Use the powerful consult interface for searching and inserting snippets.
"s i" '(consult-yasnippet :wk "insert snippet (consult)")
;; Create a new snippet for the current mode.
"s n" '(yas-new-snippet :wk "new snippet")
;; Visit (and edit) the file for an existing snippet.
"s v" '(yas-visit-snippet-file :wk "visit snippet file")
#+end_src
```
