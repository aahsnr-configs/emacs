You have raised several excellent points, and your careful reading of the reference configuration is spot on. Let's address them directly before presenting the final, fully-featured configuration.

### **Clarifications and Corrections**

1.  **Rerouting with `org-babel-jupyter-override-src-block`:** You are absolutely correct. Using the dedicated function `(org-babel-jupyter-override-src-block "python")` is the cleaner, officially supported method provided by the `emacs-jupyter` package. It's more robust than manually manipulating the `org-babel-load-languages` variable. The configuration has been updated to use this superior method.

2.  **The Role of `ob-async`:** While the reference configuration does include `ob-async`, it is **not required** for `emacs-jupyter`. The Jupyter Babel engine (`ob-jupyter`) is inherently asynchronous because it communicates with an external kernel process, which prevents Emacs from freezing during code execution. The package handles the `:async "yes"` header argument natively. Including `ob-async` is redundant for this specific setup, so it has been omitted to keep the configuration minimal and clean.

3.  **Additional Custom Functions:** You are right, the reference link contains several other highly useful helper functions that create a much better notebook experience. These have been adapted with the `ar/` prefix and integrated into the final configuration below. This includes functions for clearing all results, inserting blocks, and exporting to the `.ipynb` format.

### **Rewritten and Fully-Featured Jupyter Notebook Configuration**

Here is the complete, rewritten, and enhanced `Jupyter Notebook` section. This single block incorporates all the best practices and advanced features discussed, and it is designed to replace any previous Jupyter setup in your `init.txt`.

```org
* Jupyter Notebook
This section integrates the Jupyter ecosystem into Emacs, providing a powerful,
interactive environment for Python programming directly within Org mode. It
configures Jupyter as the primary backend for Python code execution in Org,
enabling features like asynchronous evaluation, rich multimedia output, and
interactive REPLs.

** Core Configuration
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package jupyter
  :init
  ;; Automatically create a REPL buffer when evaluating code in a buffer
  ;; that doesn't have one yet.
  (setq jupyter-python-set-repl-for-current-buffer t)
  :custom
  ;; A list of kernelspec names that should be displayed at the top of the list.
  (jupyter-favorite-kernels '("python3"))
  ;; Do not display "Evaluating..." messages in the REPL.
  (jupyter-repl-echo-evaluating-p nil)
  :config
  ;; When this is non-nil, jupyter-org buffers will get a client for the kernel
  ;; specified by the first `python' src block upon opening the file.
  (setq jupyter-org-get-client-on-load t)

  ;; Advice to automatically enter insert state when jumping to the REPL.
  ;; This is a quality-of-life improvement for Evil users.
  (advice-add 'jupyter-org-interaction-mode :after
              (lambda () (evil-insert-state))))
#+end_src

** Org Mode Integration
This configures Org Babel to delegate all Python execution to Jupyter. It uses
the officially supported override function for a seamless and robust experience.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(with-eval-after-load 'org
  ;; Use the official jupyter function to re-route all `python` src blocks to the
  ;; jupyter babel engine. This is the cleanest and most reliable method.
  (org-babel-jupyter-override-src-block "python")

  ;; Define default header arguments for all Jupyter Python source blocks.
  ;; These ensure that results are returned to a drawer and execution is async.
  (setq org-babel-default-header-args:jupyter-python
        '((:results . "replace drawer")
          (:async . "yes")
          (:session . "python")
          (:kernel . "python3")))

  ;; Add a hook to automatically redisplay inline images (like plots) after execution.
  (add-hook 'org-babel-after-execute-hook 'org-redisplay-inline-images)

  ;; Update the org-tempo snippet for "<py" to insert a standard python block,
  ;; which will now be executed by Jupyter.
  (add-to-list 'org-structure-template-alist '("py" . "src python")))
#+end_src

** Custom Functions
These helper functions streamline common notebook workflows, like clearing all
output, exporting to .ipynb, and managing the REPL.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun ar/jupyter-switch-to-repl ()
  "Switch to the Jupyter REPL buffer and go to the end."
  (interactive)
  (jupyter-org-interaction-mode)
  (with-current-buffer (jupyter-org-repl-buffer)
    (goto-char (point-max)))
  (other-window 1))

(defun ar/jupyter-insert-src-block ()
  "Insert a new python src block at point."
  (interactive)
  (org-insert-structure-template "py"))

(defun ar/jupyter-clear-all-results ()
  "Clear all Jupyter results in the current Org buffer."
  (interactive)
  (when (y-or-n-p "Clear all results in this buffer? ")
    (jupyter-org-clear-all-results)))

(defun ar/jupyter-restart-and-run-all ()
  "Restart the Jupyter kernel and evaluate all src blocks in the buffer."
  (interactive)
  (when (y-or-n-p "Restart kernel and re-evaluate all blocks? ")
    (jupyter-restart-kernel-then-execute-all)))

(defun ar/jupyter-export-to-notebook ()
  "Export the current Org buffer to a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file."
  (interactive)
  (let ((filename (read-file-name "Export to notebook: " nil nil nil (format "%s.ipynb" (file-name-sans-extension buffer-file-name)))))
    (jupyter-org-export-to-notebook nil filename)))
#+end_src

** Evil Integration
This optional section provides Vim-like keybindings for navigating and
interacting with the Jupyter REPL buffer, making it consistent with the rest of
the Evil-powered environment.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(with-eval-after-load 'evil
  (evil-define-key 'normal jupyter-repl-interaction-mode-map
    (kbd "C-j") 'jupyter-repl-next-cell-and-execute
    (kbd "C-k") 'jupyter-repl-previous-cell)
  (evil-define-key 'insert jupyter-repl-interaction-mode-map
    (kbd "C-c C-c") 'jupyter-repl-send-buffer))
#+end_src

** Keybindings
This provides a comprehensive set of global keybindings under the "org jupyter"
prefix for managing kernels and evaluating code from anywhere.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(ar/global-leader
 ;; Org Jupyter Keybindings
 "o j" '(:ignore t :wk "jupyter")
 "o j e" '(jupyter-eval-src-block :wk "Eval src block")

 "o j r" '(jupyter-restart-kernel :wk "Restart kernel")
 "o j i" '(jupyter-interrupt-kernel :wk "Interrupt kernel")
 "o j c" '(jupyter-connect-to-kernel :wk "Connect to kernel")

 "o j s" '(jupyter-switch-kernel :wk "Switch kernel")

 "o j d" '(jupyter-doc :wk "View documentation"))
#+end_src
```
