Of course. Here is a refined and more readable version of the required changes for your Emacs configuration. The instructions are broken down into logical steps with clear explanations for each modification.

***

### Emacs Configuration Refinements

This guide details the necessary changes to enhance your Emacs setup. We will address Python performance, switch to a manual Tree-sitter installation for better control, configure on-demand documentation popups, and centralize all Python-related tooling into its own dedicated section.

---

### 1. Performance & UI Enhancements

These changes provide immediate quality-of-life improvements by fixing UI lag and giving you more control over documentation popups.

#### A. Fix Python Typing Lag

The noticeable lag when typing in Python buffers is caused by `flymake` running diagnostic checks too frequently. We will configure it to run only when you explicitly save the file.

> In your `*Syntax Checking` section, replace the entire `(use-package flymake ...)` block with the following:

```el
(use-package flymake
  :defer t
  :ensure nil
  :hook (prog-mode . flymake-mode)
  :custom
  ;; This is the key change to improve performance. Diagnostics now only run on
  ;; save or when the mode is first enabled, not while you are typing.
  (flymake-check-syntax-automatically '(save mode-enabled))
  (flymake-idle-change-delay 0.4)
  :custom-face
  (flymake-error   ((t (:underline (:style wave :color "#f7768e") :inherit nil))))
  (flymake-warning ((t (:underline (:style wave :color "#e0af68") :inherit nil))))
  (flymake-note    ((t (:underline (:style wave :color "#73daca") :inherit nil)))))
```

#### B. Configure On-Demand Documentation

To prevent the Eldoc documentation box from appearing automatically, we will disable the automatic trigger and bind it to a key.

1.  **Modify the `eldoc-box` package:**
    > In your `*Eldoc Box` section, replace the existing `use-package` block. The `:hook` is removed to prevent it from activating automatically.

    ```emacs-lisp
    (use-package eldoc-box
      :commands (eldoc-box-show-doc) ; Command to be called manually
      :custom
      (eldoc-box-show-if-no-doc nil)
      (eldoc-echo-area-display-truncation-p nil)
      :custom-face
      (eldoc-box-border ((t (:foreground "#3b4261"))))
      (eldoc-highlight-symbol-face ((t (:foreground "#7aa2f7" :weight bold)))))
    ```

2.  **Add the Keybinding:**
    > In your `*Keybindings` section under `*Development Environment`, add a keymap for `l h d` to manually show the documentation.

    ```emacs-lisp
    (ar/global-leader
     "l" '(:ignore t :which-key "lsp (eglot)")
     ;; ... (your other lsp keybindings remain here)
     "l h" '(:ignore t :which-key "help")
     "l h h" '(eldoc-doc-buffer :wk "show full documentation")
     "l h d" '(eldoc-box-show-doc :wk "show doc in popup")) ;; <-- ADD THIS LINE
    ```

---

### 2. Manual & Controlled Tree-sitter Installation

We will replace `treesit-auto` with a more explicit setup that gives you full control over which language grammars are installed and ensures they are placed within your `~/.config/emacs/var/` directory.

1.  **Remove Old Packages:**
    > Delete the entire `(use-package treesit-auto ...)` block and the `(use-package treesit-fold ...)` block from your configuration.

2.  **Add New Tree-sitter Section:**
    > Add the following new `** Tree-sitter` subsection inside your `*Development Environment` section.

    ```org
    ** Tree-sitter
    This section configures Tree-sitter for modern syntax parsing. It replaces
    `treesit-auto` with a manual installation system to give you full control over
    which grammars are installed and where they are stored.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (use-package treesit
      :ensure nil ; Built-in
      :defer t
      :init
      ;; Set the installation directory to respect the no-littering setup.
      (setq treesit-install-dir (expand-file-name "treesit" no-littering-var-directory))
      ;; Ensure the directory exists.
      (make-directory treesit-install-dir :parents t)

      :config
      ;; Define the list of grammars you want to have installed.
      (defvar ar/treesit-grammars
        '(bash python markdown markdown_inline toml yaml json rust go c cpp)
        "A list of tree-sitter grammars to ensure are installed.")

      ;; Function to install grammars if they are not already present.
      (defun ar/treesit-install-grammars-if-needed ()
        "For each language in `ar/treesit-grammars`, install its grammar if missing."
        (dolist (lang ar/treesit-grammars)
          (unless (treesit-language-available-p lang)
            (message "Installing missing tree-sitter grammar: %s" lang)
            (treesit-install-language-grammar lang))))

      ;; Run the installation after startup. This may take a moment on first launch.
      (add-hook 'after-init-hook #'ar/treesit-install-grammars-if-needed)

      ;; Manually remap major modes to use their tree-sitter variants.
      (setq major-mode-remap-alist
            '((python-mode . python-ts-mode)
              (sh-mode . bash-ts-mode)
              (markdown-mode . markdown-ts-mode)))

      ;; Enable folding for all tree-sitter modes.
      (add-hook 'treesit-mode-hook #'treesit-fold-mode))
    #+end_src
    ```

---

### 3. Centralized Python Environment

To improve organization, we will move all Python-specific configurations into a new, dedicated section.

1.  **Make the Eglot Configuration Generic:**
    > First, update your main Eglot configuration to be language-agnostic by removing the Python-specific rule. In `*Language Server Protocol: Eglot & Eglot Booster`, replace the `use-package` block with this:

    ```emacs-lisp
    (use-package eglot
      :ensure nil
      :hook ((prog-mode . eglot-ensure)
             (org-src-mode . eglot-ensure))
      :custom
      (eglot-autoshutdown t))
    ```

2.  **Add the New `*Python*` Section:**
    > Finally, add this new top-level section to your `init.txt`. It cleanly centralizes all Python tooling, including LSP (`pyright`), formatting (`black`), and linting (`pylint`).

    ```org
    * Python
    This section provides a complete Python development environment, including LSP
    support via Pyright, linting with Pylint, and formatting with Black.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; ==========================================================================
    ;; Note: For this to work, you must have the following tools installed in
    ;; your environment (e.g., via `pip` or another package manager):
    ;;   - `pyright` (or `pyright-langserver` from npm)
    ;;   - `black`
    ;;   - `pylint`
    ;; ==========================================================================

    ;; Configure the Eglot language server for Python.
    ;; This ensures that both `python-mode` and `python-ts-mode` use `pyright`.
    (with-eval-after-load 'eglot
      (add-to-list 'eglot-server-programs
                   '((python-ts-mode python-mode) . ("pyright-langserver" "--stdio"))))

    ;; Configure the Apheleia formatter for Python.
    ;; This sets up `black` to format Python buffers on save.
    (with-eval-after-load 'apheleia
      (setf (alist-get 'python-ts-mode apheleia-formatters)
            '("black"))
      (setf (alist-get 'python-mode apheleia-formatters)
            '("black")))

    ;; Flymake Linter for Python (Pylint)
    ;; The `flymake-collection` package, already configured in your setup, will
    ;; automatically enable the `python-pylint` checker if `pylint` is found in
    ;; your system's PATH. No extra configuration is needed here.
    #+end_src
    ```

By implementing these changes, your Emacs configuration will be faster, better organized, and will provide a more controlled and powerful development experience, especially for Python.
