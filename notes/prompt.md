Study the emacs configuration in the attached files carefully. Then, write a comprehensive polymode (from https://github.com/polymode/polymode) configuration and a comprehensive poly-org (from https://github.com/polymode/poly-org) configuration for the emacs configuration in the attached emacs files. This configuration allows the user to write latex formatted documents in org-mode using auctex and includes support for lsp using texlab as backend, syntax checking, formatting and completion. The configuration should also allow the user to python programming in org-mode inside org source code blocks using jupyter kernels, and also include support for lsp using pyright, syntax-checking, formatting and completion. Also make sure the polymode configuration is integrated for all the configurations in the whole emacs configuration. As a result, emacs would be a perfect IDE for python programming using jupyter kernels in org-mode files and a perfect writing environment for writing scientific documents in org-mode files. Then write out the changes that are needed in a nicely formatted markdown output. Don't rewrite the whole emacs configuration. Do not introduce errors.

For the emacs configuration in the attached init.txt file, write a comprehensive development environment for python programming. Use pyright as lsp using eglot, configurare flymake to use ruff, mypy, and bandit, configuration apheleia to use ruff, use debugby as debugger using dape. Furthermore, make sure pyright has linting/formatting diagnostics disabled. Keep in mind my emacs configuration contains flymake-collection which preinstalls that contains many packages. The development environment configuration must be well integrated with the rest of my emacs configuration. Make sure this development environment configuratin has its own separtate section titled 'Python Development'. Do not introduce errors. Don't rewrite the whole emacs configuration. Only write out the changes in a nicely formatted and readable markdown output.

Study the jupyter configuration in the attached link: https://sqrtminusone.xyz/configs/emacs . Then integrate the jupyter configuration into my own emacs configuration in the attached init.txt file in a separate 'Jupyter Notebook' section. Keep in mind that the s.el library is automatically installed when the jupyter package is installed. Any changes to the org-mode sections should also be placed in 'Jupyter Notebook' section. But keep in mind not bring the whole changed parts to this section. Don't forget to leave any configuration out. The keybindings should use ar/global-leader and be place in this section as well. The python org-babel should be replaced by jupyter-python. The goal is provide a seamless environment to provide jupyter notebook experience in org-mode for python programming. Don't rewrite the whole emacs configuration. Only write out the changes in a nicely formatted and readable markdown output. Don't introduce errors.

For the 'rerouting' part, wouldn't be easier to easier to use this '(org-babel-jupyter-override-src-block "python")' from https://sqrtminusone.xyz/configs/emacs instead of what you wrote. The configuration from this link use ob-sync. Are you sure ob-sync is not required? Furthermore, you didn't many other custom functions that the emacs configuration in the provided link has. Do that as well. Make the necessary changes and rewrite the whole jupyter notebook configuration from the previous output with the new changes in a nicely formatted and readable markdown output.
