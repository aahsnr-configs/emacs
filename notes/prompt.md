The attached vanilla-emacs.md file forms the 1st iteration of `final-emacs-config`. For the 2nd iteration, study vanilla-emacs.md first, then study the following attached configuration files: init-completion.md, init-highlight.md, init-org.md, init-edit.md, and init-lsp.md. Then implement and integrate any useful and/or necessary configurations from these into vanilla-emacs.md so that you get the 2nd iteration of `final-emacs-config`. You don't need to rewrite the whole emacs configuration for `final-emacs-config`. Only write out the changes that are needed in a nicely formatted and readable markdown output.
