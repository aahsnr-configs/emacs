Study the emacs configuration in the attached files carefully. Then, write a comprehensive polymode (from https://github.com/polymode/polymode) configuration and a comprehensive poly-org (from https://github.com/polymode/poly-org) configuration for the emacs configuration in the attached emacs files. This configuration allows the user to write latex formatted documents in org-mode using auctex and includes support for lsp using texlab as backend, syntax checking, formatting and completion. The configuration should also allow the user to python programming in org-mode inside org source code blocks using jupyter kernels, and also include support for lsp using pyright, syntax-checking, formatting and completion. Also make sure the polymode configuration is integrated for all the configurations in the whole emacs configuration. As a result, emacs would be a perfect IDE for python programming using jupyter kernels in org-mode files and a perfect writing environment for writing scientific documents in org-mode files. Then write out the changes that are needed in a nicely formatted markdown output. Don't rewrite the whole emacs configuration. Do not introduce errors.

The emacs configuration in the attached files gives me the error in the attached screenshot. Fix that and write out the changes needed in a nicely formatted markdown output. Don't rewrite the whole emacs configuration.
