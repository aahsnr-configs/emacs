Of course. Dealing with a complex Emacs configuration requires a careful and structured approach. Based on your provided files and the philosophy of the `minimal-emacs.d` project, I've identified several issues ranging from critical performance bottlenecks to minor errors and redundancies.

Here is a detailed analysis and set of corrections for your Emacs setup.

## Emacs Configuration Review and Fixes

### 1. The Biggest Issue: Slow Startup Time

The primary reason your Emacs is loading in 2.2 seconds instead of the sub-second time you're aiming for is this line in your `post-init.el`:

```el
(org-babel-load-file "~/.emacs.d/config.org")
```

This command instructs Emacs to parse the entire `config.org` file, tangle out all the source blocks, and then evaluate them *every single time you start Emacs*. This is a very time-consuming process and defeats the purpose of the `minimal-emacs.d` framework, which is built on deferring as much as possible.

**The Fix:**

You should adopt a "tangle-on-save" approach. The idea is to generate a plain Elisp file (`.el`) from your Org file only when you modify it. Emacs will then load this much faster, pre-tangled file at startup.

1.  **Remove the line** from `post-init.el`.
2.  Replace it with:

    ```el
    ;;; post-init.el --- Load tangled configuration ---
    (require 'org) ;; Ensure org is available for the next line
    (org-babel-load-file (expand-file-name "config.org" user-emacs-directory))
    ```

    Wait, isn't this what I just told you to remove? Yes. We're going to change how it works. You should change the header arguments on a per-file basis so that it tangles to a specific file.

3.  **Modify `config.org`:** Add a file-level property to automatically tangle the contents to `~/.emacs.d/lisp/config.el` whenever you save the Org file.

    Add this line at the top of your `config.org` file:

    ```org
    #+PROPERTY: header-args :tangle (expand-file-name "lisp/config.el" user-emacs-directory)
    ```

    Now, every time you save `config.org` (with `C-x C-s`), Org mode will automatically generate the `config.el` file for you.

4.  **Update `post-init.el` to load the tangled file:** Your `post-init.el` should be changed to this:

    ```el
    ;;; post-init.el --- Load custom configuration ---
    (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "lisp" user-emacs-directory))
    (require 'config)
    ```

This change alone will be the most significant factor in reducing your startup time.

### 2. Configuration Errors and Redundancies in `config.org`

I've reviewed your literate configuration and found several areas for improvement.

#### General Issues

*   **`pre-early-init.el` Variable:** The variable `minimal-emacs-user-directory` is set by the framework's `init.el`. However, you are using it in `pre-early-init.el`, which runs *before* `init.el`. You should use the standard `user-emacs-directory` instead.
    *   **Fix:** In `pre-early-init.el`, change `minimal-emacs-user-directory` to `user-emacs-directory`.
*   **Redundant `display-buffer-alist`:** You define `display-buffer-alist` in the "Popup Management" section and then add to it again for `embark`. These should be consolidated.
*   **Typo in Org Habit:** There is a clear typo in your org-habit configuration.
    *   **Error:** `(org-habit-https://github.com/jamescherti/minimal-emacs.dpregraph-format "  ")`
    *   **Fix:** `(org-habit-pregraph-format "  ")`

#### Performance Optimizations (Deferring Packages)

Many packages are loaded immediately (`:demand t`) or implicitly with `:config` when they could be loaded lazily.

*   **`doom-themes`**: While a theme is often desired at startup, using `:demand t` forces it to load immediately. This is acceptable but has a cost.
*   **`evil`**: Using `:demand t` is correct here, as you want Vim emulation available from the very beginning.
*   **`rainbow-delimiters`**: Using `:demand t` is unnecessary. The hook is sufficient to load it when needed.
    *   **Fix:** Remove `:demand t` from the `rainbow-delimiters` configuration.
*   **`nerd-icons-completion`**: `:demand t` is not needed; it can be loaded when `marginalia-mode` is activated.
    *   **Fix:** Replace `:demand t` with `:after marginalia` and `:hook (marginalia-mode . nerd-icons-completion-marginalia-setup)`.
*   **`perspective`**: The `(persp-mode +1)` call in `:init` loads the package immediately. This can be deferred until after startup.
    *   **Fix:** Move `(persp-mode +1)` from `:init` into a `:config` block and add `(add-hook 'emacs-startup-hook #'persp-mode)`.

### Corrected Code Snippets for `config.org`

Here are some specific `use-package` blocks with suggested corrections.

**Rainbow Delimiters (Optimized)**
```el
(use-package rainbow-delimiters
  :hook ((text-mode . rainbow-delimiters-mode)
         (prog-mode . rainbow-delimiters-mode)
         (org-src-mode-hook . rainbow-delimiters-mode))
  ;; Custom faces updated for the Tokyonight color palette.
  :custom-face
  (rainbow-delimiters-depth-1-face ((t (:foreground "#7aa2f7"))))
  ;; ... other faces
)
```

**Perspective (Optimized for lazy loading)**
```el
(use-package perspective
  :defer t
  :init
  ;; Set the state file location before enabling the mode.
  (setq persp-state-default-file (expand-file-name "perspectives" user-emacs-directory))
  ;; REQUIRED for Emacs 28+: Set a native prefix key.
  (setq persp-mode-prefix-key (kbd "C-c p"))
  :custom
  (persp-auto-kill-on-last-buffer-close t)
  :config
  ;; Enable the mode *after* Emacs has started and is idle
  (add-hook 'emacs-startup-hook #'persp-mode 1)

  ;; Custom function to automatically create or switch to a project-specific perspective.
  (defun ar/perspective-switch-or-create ()
    "Switch to a perspective named after the current project, creating it if needed."
    (interactive)
    (let ((project-name (projectile-project-name)))
      (unless (string= project-name "-") ; Ignore if not in a project
        (if (get-perspective project-name)
            (persp-switch project-name)
          (persp-add-new project-name)
          (persp-switch project-name)))))
  (add-hook 'projectile-after-switch-project-hook #'ar/perspective-switch-or-create)

  (when (file-exists-p persp-state-default-file)
    (persp-load-state-from-file persp-state-default-file))

  ;; Keybindings remain the same
  (ar/global-leader
   "w" '(:ignore t :which-key "workspaces")
   "w n" '(persp-next :wk "next workspace")
   "w p" '(persp-prev :wk "previous workspace")
   ;; ... other keys
  )
)
```

**Popup Management (Consolidated)**
```el
(setq display-buffer-alist
      '(;; Match buffers whose names start with a '*' (e.g., *Help*, *Messages*).
        ("\\`\\*.*\\*\\'"
         (display-buffer-in-side-window)
         (side . bottom)
         (window-height . 0.25)
         (inhibit-same-window . t)
         (inhibit-switch-frame . t))

        ;; Rule for Embark Collect buffers
        ("\\`\\*Embark Collect \\(Live\\|Completions\\)\\*\\'"
         . ((display-buffer-in-side-window)
            (side . bottom)
            (window-height . 0.25)
            (mode-line-format . none)))))

;; Additionally, configure which-key to use a smaller, less intrusive popup.
(setq which-key-side-window-max-height 0.25)
```

**Org Habit (Corrected)**
```el
(use-package org-habit
  :ensure nil
  :after org
  :custom
  (org-habit-graph-column 60)
  (org-habit-show-habits-only-for-today t)
  (org-habit-pregraph-format "  ") ;; Corrected typo
  (org-habit-graph-mature-star "‚úÖ")
  (org-habit-graph-fresh-star "üëå")
  (org-habit-graph-ready-star "üëç")
  (org-habit-graph-early-star "üå±")
  (org-habit-graph-late-star "üëé")
  (org-habit-graph-future-star "‚Ä¶"))
```

### 3. Summary and Action Plan

1.  **Fix Startup Method**: Immediately implement the "tangle-on-save" workflow. This is the most important change.
2.  **Correct Errors**: Apply the fixes for the `pre-early-init.el` variable and the `org-habit` typo.
3.  **Optimize `config.org`**: Go through your `use-package` declarations and remove unnecessary `:demand t` flags and defer loading with hooks where possible, as shown in the examples.
4.  **Consolidate Redundancies**: Merge your `display-buffer-alist` configurations into a single, clean block.
5.  **Empty Sections**: Your configuration has several sections marked `TODO` or left empty (like `Dirvish` and `Debug Adapter Protocol`). These are harmless but consider filling them in or removing them to keep your configuration clean.

By following these steps, you will be aligning your setup with the performance-oriented philosophy of `minimal-emacs.d`, which relies on lazy loading. While a complex configuration with over 100 packages will not load in 0.22s, you should see a dramatic improvement from your current 2.2s load time.
