# PLAN for custom centuar emacs fork
**Important** When writing all the contents of the org file and lisp folder files, make sure to compare it without the original centaur emacs config
- [ ] place the following files in lisp subfolder:
     - [ ] init-const
     - [ ] init-custom
     - [ ] init-functions
- [ ] Place all the code of `init.el` inside an `config.org` file
- [ ] In `config.org` replace `(require 'init-package)` with the whole contents of the `init-package.el` file. The order of place will be the same as the original init.el file from centaur emacs
- [ ]
